# ChurnGuard – AI-Powered Customer Churn Prediction & Retention System

## 📌 Overview
ChurnGuard is an AI-powered web application designed to predict customer churn
and transform machine learning outputs into actionable business insights.
A machine learning model was developed to analyze customer behavior,
transaction patterns, and engagement metrics to estimate churn risk.

Unlike traditional churn prediction systems, ChurnGuard converts churn
probability into decision-ready outputs such as customer priority scoring,
retention recommendations, revenue loss estimation, and real-time alerts.
